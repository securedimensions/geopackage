[big]*iii.   Preface*

The OGC GeoPackage Encryption Extension was originally developed and implemented in the OGC Testbed 17 inititive and documented in the OGC Testbed-17 Data Centric Security Engineering Report. Follow up work in the OGC Disaster-Pilot 2021 simplified the data structure based on disaster use cases. Also, a more holistic security solution, including confidentiality and integrity, was developed. The resulting is publishedfootnote:[Not yet]* in the Disaster Pilot 2021 Summary Engineering Report.

Any GeoPackage file, based on this encryption extension includes the new table `gpkg_ext_keys` that stores metadata about the (symmetric) cipher key used to encrypt the actual data stored in the `features` or `tiles` table(s). In addition, this extension re-defines the `features` and `tiles` user data table by stating that the `data` column contains encrypted features, resp. `tile_data` column contains encrypted tiles, and that the additional column `key_id` is a foreign key into the `gpkg_ext_keys` table.
